#Description

##Welcome to my first mock landing page!

1. In this project, I worked on making a website for a family members car service company NYC Connections Limo Service.
During this project, I learned a lot (especially googling some CSS questions!) and wanted to create a simple but clean home page.

2. I mostly used HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript for this, but hope to add more to it with the zip code search bar.

3. Some of the challenges was definitely the JavaScript portion. It's an area I'm excited to work on. Making the pages to the Nav bar links is also something I'm looking forward to as well!
